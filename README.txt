README updated: 2022-03-09

Project in collaboration with Susanne Wengle and Raushan Zhandayeva. Goal is to examine the precipitation
patterns/trends across Eurasian's "Black Earth Belt" region (Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine).

Maps made possible using data from "Rainfall Estimates on a Gridded Network based on all station data v1-2019."
Aggregated by Steefan Contractor. Managed by ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science Data Manager.

**Folders**
"GIS": Encompasses files associated with the GIS component of the project that uses REGEN 
data to better understand rainfall patterns from 1971-2016. See "eurasian-rainfall_GIS_README.txt" for seperate README.txt on GIS-related files.
"rainfall-stations": Encpompasses an inventory of GHCND weather stations in various Eurasian countries.
"RProject-Eurasian-Rainfall": Includes files used in a R project that attempts to visualize rainfall patterns as
reflected by data from relevant GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily) weather stations.

**Misc. Files**
"1961-2020-kaz-ua-rus_rawLegacy.csv": Weather station data from 1961-2020 for Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine.
"BlackEarthBeltOblasts.txt": List of oblasts that encompass the "Black Earth Belt."
"ghcnd-stations.txt": Inventory of GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily) weather stations.
